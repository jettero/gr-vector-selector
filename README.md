gr-vector-selector
===========

I was experimenting with the gr-fft module, which outputs long vectors.  I
became particularly curious what a constilation plot of a single tap would look
like â€” it seems pretty obvious if you've looked at the map, but I wanted to see
it.

I couldn't find a vector operator that would select an arbitrary position (e.g.,
the 13th index of every FFT vector) and create a stream of it.  There are built
in operators to go from streams to vectors, and vectors to streams, but none
that decimate in this particular way (afaik).

Requirements

GNU Radio 3.7
python 

*Installing GNU Radio*

maybe just run:
sudo apt-get install gnuradio

or maybe see this page:
http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/InstallingGR


*Installing gr-pyserial*

buildname=gr-vector-selector
buildloc=/tmp/$buildname

git clone http://github.com/jettero/$buildname.git
cd $buildname
src="$(pwd)"
mkdir $buildloc
cd $buildloc
# skip the -DMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want /usr/local
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr "$src"
sudo make install

# *or* just use my build script
bash build.sh /my/install/prefix/here
